# Interactive Drawing Tool 🎨

This project was born out of my own experience with the challenges of Computer Graphics labs during my third year of B.E Computer Science. Like many students, I found the process of manually calculating coordinates for each line in C language using graphics libraries to be tedious and time-consuming. To address this problem, I created this GUI-based drawing tool in C#.

## Features
- ✏️ User-friendly interface similar to Windows drawing tools.
- 🖼️ Drawing canvas where users can freely draw shapes and lines.
- 📝 Ability to obtain coordinates for each drawn element.
- 💾 Option to save drawings for future reference.
- 🔍 Opacity feature for tracing images with varying transparency.

## How to Use
1. **Drawing**: Use the mouse to draw shapes and lines on the canvas.
2. **Coordinates**: Each drawn element will have its coordinates displayed for easy reference.
3. **Save**: Save your drawings to use the coordinates in your C programs for generating graphics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the project to launch the GUI drawing tool.
4. Start drawing and exploring the features!
